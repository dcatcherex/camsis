Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide accommodation for this.Government regulations in the UK outline that from 11th February 2022 all testing measures will be removed for fully vaccinated travellers coming into the country. If you are fully vaccinated and do not have any COVID symptoms, you will therefore not need to be tested before you travel or join your course. It’s also important to note that all under 18s will be treated as fully vaccinated. Therefore participants joining our 14-18 year old programmes will not need to be tested whether they are vaccinated or not. Visit the UK Government website [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19) for more information on testing regulations for travellers.If a participant from a **[red list country](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories)** is due to travel within 28 days of the starting date but is unable (due to the mandatory quarantine), they will be eligible for one of three options:Participants based in the UK or arriving from countries not on the red list are expected to attend as planned, and our standard **terms and conditions** apply if cancelling.If you simply wish to amend your programme dates or subject, please send an email to [info@camsiseducation.com](mailto:info@camsiseducation.com) outlining the changes, and we will accommodate this where possible.The safety and wellbeing of our staff and participants is our highest priority.
