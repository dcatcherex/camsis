        CAMSIS Education's Commitment to Safeguarding
      </h2>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-outside pl-5 text-justify">
        <li>
          CAMSIS Education recognises its responsibility for safeguarding and
          promoting the welfare of children. CAMSIS Education seeks to establish
          a safe and nurturing environment for all students. Because of the
          day-to-day contact with children, CAMSIS Education Staff have a
          responsibility to be vigilant to the outward signs of abuse, and act
          if they know or suspect that a child is being abused. Safeguarding is
          the responsibility of everyone within the company that may come into
          contact with children on the course. CAMSIS Education will apply this
          policy equally to any child regardless of age, gender, ethnicity,
          disability, sexuality, faith or belief.
        </li>
        <li>
          CAMSIS Education will:
          <ul>
            <li>Uphold a culture of ongoing vigilance towards safeguarding</li>
            <li>Treat safeguarding as everyone's responsibility</li>
            <li>
              Maintain openness around discussing concerns in the belief that
              'it could happen here'{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure students know they can approach any adult at CAMSIS
              Education and they will receive a consistent, supportive response{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide clear procedures and support for reporting concerns and
              setting acceptable standards of behaviour{" "}
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          This means that all staff, whether seasonal or permanent, are
          contractually required to report any safeguarding concerns to a
          Designated Safeguarding Lead and undertake safeguarding training, as
          deemed appropriate by CAMSIS Education. We have established and will
          maintain links with relevant agencies and co-operate as required with
          enquiries of a child protection nature. We will keep accurate written
          records of concerns on students even where referral is not appropriate
          immediately and ensure that all child protection records are kept
          securely, remain confidential, and separate from the main student
          file.
        </li>
        <li>
          This also means that CAMSIS Education will undertake to follow the
          specific Local Authority's Safeguarding Children's Board procedures
          for all locations in which we deliver our courses. In all cases of
          abuse, or suspected abuse, we acknowledge the statutory obligations
          placed on us by Section 157 of the 2011 Education Act. We will
          therefore ensure that this policy and our procedures are consistent
          with the requirements of:

          We will review our policy and procedures annually with all changes
          communicated to staff and we will ensure that we have a designated
          Member of Staff for safeguarding who has received appropriate training
          and support for this role. We will also maintain a number of
          Designated Safeguarding Leads, currently listed as:

          All staff will have access to requisite training for their role, this
          includes ensuring that:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The designated Member of Staff receives updated training (child
              protection and inter-agency work) every 2 years approved by the
              BAC and that this training is disseminated to all others in CAMSIS
              Education at least every 3 years in line with statutory
              requirements.{" "}

            <li>
              All staff responsible for the decision on hiring staff who will

            <li>
              Seasonal Staff and voluntary Staff who work with children are to
              be trained in CAMSIS Education' safeguarding procedures. This
              includes ensuring that:
              <ul>

                  All newly appointed staff and volunteers will have induction

                  All staff are aware that any inappropriate relationship
                  between staff and a participant of any age on the course will
                  result in instant dismissal. In cases where the law is broken,
                  the appropriate authorities shall be involved.{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  All staff, volunteers and interns understand their

                  in, cases of abuse or suspected abuse.{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  All staff are aware of their pastoral responsibilities (as
                  outlined in their contracts and job specifications) and that
                  any other type of relationship between a staff member and
                  course participants, regardless of their age (including
                  students aged over 18 years of age), will be deemed
                  inappropriate and shall lead to instant dismissal. Please
                  refer to Positions of Trust (paragraph 11).
                </li>
                <li>
                  All staff, trustees and volunteers understand that there is a
                  procedure to be followed in dealing with allegations made
                  against teaching and non-teaching staff and volunteers. This
                  procedure must be followed on all occasions (see Department
                  for Education guidance: Dealing with Allegations of Abuse
                  against Teachers and Other Staff available from the Child

            Safer Recruitment and Delayed Suitability Checks
          </h2>
        </li>
        <li>
          All our staff, whether seasonal or permanent, will be recruited in
          accordance with our Safer Recruitment policy, which includes:
          <ul>
            <li>
              DBS check and Barred List check, or (international) a Certificate
              of Good Conduct from their local police (translated).
            </li>
            <li>
              Before employment begins, validated reference checks which
              specifically indicate the candidate’s suitability to work with
              vulnerable adults and children under the age of 18.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reporting to the Disclosure and Barring Service any person
              (whether employed, contracted, volunteer or student) whose
              services are no longer used because he or she is considered
              unsuitable to work with children. This will be done within one
              month of the individual leaving the Company.
            </li>
            <li>
              In cases where a member of residential staff is suspended pending
              investigation of a child protection nature we will undertake to
              resolve the investigation as quickly as reasonably possible to
              enable the member of staff to return to their accommodation.
              CAMSIS Education may, at our discretion based on the nature of the
              investigation, provide alternative accommodation{" "}

            Delayed Suitability Checks where a DBS or equivalent suitability
            check has been applied for but not yet received for a member of

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If residential, the member of staff will be accommodated in a part

            <li>
              Unsupervised access to students will not be allowed until a

            </li>
            <li>
              Teachers will only teach with the door open; or, with a DBS’d
              member of staff present in the room; or, a DBS’d member of staff

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Prevention and Support</h2>
        </li>
        <li>
          We recognise that high self-esteem, confidence, supportive friends and
          good lines of communication with a trusted adult helps to safeguard
          students. The Company will therefore:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Establish and maintain an ethos where children are encouraged to
              talk, and are listened to.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure children know that there are staff whom they can approach
              if they are worried or in difficulty.{" "}
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            At CAMSIS Education, we respect the students. The atmosphere is one
            that encourages all students to do their best. We provide
            opportunities that enable the students to take and make decisions
            for themselves. We recognise that abuse and neglect can result in
            underachievement. We strive to ensure that all our children make
            optimum educational progress.{" "}
          </p>
        </li>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Student and Staff Ratios</h2>
        <li>
          In the interests of student and staff welfare, courses will be staffed
          to support a ratio of:
          <ul>
            <li>13-17. 2 staff member to 15 students</li>
            <li>The levels are minimum. Also applicable:</li>
            <li>Never less than 2 residential staff with a 13+ age group</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Adult-Child Interaction</h2>
        <li>
          {" "}
          Positions of Trust. Adults who work with children should avoid any
          conduct which would lead any reasonable person to question their
          motivation and intentions. Adults working with under 18s are in a
          Position of Trust; the Sexual Offences Act (2003) states that any
          person in a position of trust engaged in a sexual activity of any sort
          with students under the age of 18 is breaking the law even though the
          UK legal age of consent is 16.
        </li>
        <li>
          Physical Contact. There are occasions when it is entirely appropriate
          for staff to have some physical contact with children but this should
          always be consistent with their professional role and
          responsibilities. These situations may include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              When a child is in distress – staff should comfort or reassure a
              child in an age-appropriate way whilst maintaining clear
              professional boundaries
            </li>
            <li>
              For restraint and physical intervention - if staff have failed to
              diffuse situations any other way, physical intervention may be
              used to manage a child’s or young person’s behaviour if it is
              necessary to prevent personal injury to the child, other children
              or an adult, to prevent serious damage to property or in what
              would reasonably be regarded as exceptional circumstances. When
              physical intervention is used it should be undertaken in such a
              way that maintains the safety and dignity of all concerned
            </li>
            <li>
              First Aid – staff should ensure another member of staff is aware
              of the action being taken, explain to the student what is
              happening and record it. Physical contact should take place only
              when it is necessary in relation to a particular activity. It
              should take place in a safe and open environment, i.e. one easily
              observed by others, and be for the minimum time necessary.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Staff should:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Not use physical force as a means of punishment and discipline.
              The use of unwarranted force may constitute a criminal offence
            </li>
            <li>
              Not touch a student in any way that could be considered
              inappropriate
            </li>
            <li>Not indulge in horse-play </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Behaviour Management. Staff should not use any form of degrading
          treatment to punish students. Sarcasm and demeaning or insensitive
          comments are not acceptable. The use of corporal punishment is not
          acceptable. Any sanctions or rewards should be in line with the
          company’s policy as outlined in the training and the Staff Handbook.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fairness. Staff should exercise care when selecting students for
          specific activities or privileges to avoid perceptions of favouritism
          or unfairness. Methods and criteria for selection should always be
          transparent and subject to scrutiny.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use of appropriate language. Staff should:
          <ul>
            <li>Not shout at students (except in situations of danger)</li>
            <li>Not swear in the vicinity of or at students</li>
            <li>Not ridicule or bully students</li>
            <li>
              Not make suggestive remarks or gestures towards students (or
              towards colleagues while students are present)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Infatuations and Sexual Contact. Occasionally, a student may develop
          an infatuation with an adult who works with them. Staff should deal
          with these situations sensitively and appropriately to maintain the
          dignity and safety of all concerned. They should remain aware,
          however, that such infatuations carry a high risk of words or actions
          being misinterpreted and should therefore make every effort to ensure
          that their own behaviour is above reproach.
          <ul>
            <li>
              An adult, who becomes aware that a child or young person is
              developing an infatuation, should discuss this at the earliest
              opportunity with the On-site College Manager so appropriate action
              can be taken to avoid any hurt, distress or embarrassment. There
              is further guidance in the Staff Handbook, which is provided to
              all on-course staff.
            </li>
            <li>
              All staff should clearly understand the need to maintain
              appropriate boundaries in their contacts with children. Intimate
              or sexual relationships between students and staff will be
              regarded as a grave breach of trust. Allowing or encouraging a
              relationship to develop in a way which might lead to a sexual
              relationship is also unacceptable.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Any sexual activity may be regarded as a criminal offence and will
              always be a matter for disciplinary action. Children are protected
              by specific legal provisions regardless of whether they consent or
              not. The sexual activity referred to does not just involve
              physical contact including penetrative and non-penetrative acts.
              It may also include non-contact activities, such as causing
              children to engage in or watch sexual activity.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Staff should:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Not have any form of communication with child which could be
                  interpreted as sexually suggestive or provocative i.e. verbal
                  comments, letters, notes, electronic mail, phone calls, texts,
                  physical contact{" "}
                </li>
                <li>Not make sexual remarks to, or about, a child </li>
                <li>
                  Not discuss their own sexual relationships with or in the
                  presence of children{" "}
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Appropriate appearance. Staff should dress in ways that are
          appropriate to their role and in line with the company dress code.
          Clothing should not be revealing, sexually provocative or give rise to
          misunderstanding or political/cultural offence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alcohol, drugs & smoking. Staff must abide by the alcohol, drugs and
          smoking policies provided to them in this pack and in their training
          materials.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Staff must not have consumed alcohol prior to supervising students
              or return to houses/colleges under the influence of alcohol which
              causes their behaviour to be disruptive or makes them a risk to
              students.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              All CAMSIS Education sites are non-smoking environments. Staff are
              not permitted to smoke anywhere on any campuses including boarding
              houses. Students must be informed of the smoking ban and that
              disciplinary action will be enforced if the ban is ignored.
            </li>
            <li>
              Smoking inside a building is a serious matter due to the fire risk
              and tainting of interior decoration, so this would prompt a formal
              warning as per the disciplinary procedures. Minor infringements
              can probably be covered by a verbal warning, though repeat
              offenders will need to be dealt with sternly.
            </li>
            <li>
              We need to recognise that in some countries smoking is less of a
              taboo than in the UK and parents may permit even quite young
              students to smoke. Nevertheless, we have to adhere strictly to our
              non-smoking policy for both staff and students as per our
              agreement with schools/colleges.
            </li>
            <li>
              Proven drug taking/buying will result in the staff member being
              removed immediately from their position. Students proved to have
              bought/taken drugs will be immediately removed from the course and
              sent home at the earliest opportunity.

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Communication with students. Communication between students and staff,
          by whatever method, should take place within clear and explicit
          professional boundaries. This includes the wider use of technology
          such as mobile phones, text messaging, e-mails, digital cameras,
          videos, web-cams, websites and blogs. Staff should not share any
          personal information with a student. They should not request, or
          respond to, any personal information from the student (during and
          after the course) and should ensure that all communications are
          transparent and open to scrutiny. Therefore staff should:
          <ul>
            <li>Only make contact with students for professional reasons</li>
            <li>
              Recognise that messaging is rarely an appropriate response to a
              child in a crisis situation or at risk of harm. It should only be
              used as a last resort when other forms of communication are not
              possible – direct calling should be the first resort when a
              student is in a crisis situation or at risk of harm
            </li>
            <li>
              Not use internet or web-based communication channels to send
              personal messages to a child – always have at least a second staff
              member included in all communications{" "}
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Accommodation. All staff should note that among the higher-risk times
          in accommodation settings houses are the following:
          <ul>
            <li>early morning when students are getting up</li>
            <li>at bedtime/lights out </li>
            <li>during showering, particularly if house is mixed sex </li>
            <li>when students are getting changed for sports activities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In order to minimise risks, staff must adhere to the following,
            except where doing so may prejudice student safety:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              During higher-risk times members of staff must keep to same sex
              accommodation areas or common areas on the ground floor. If not
              applicable, members of staff must not enter a student’s bedroom of
              the opposite sex.
            </li>
            <li>
              No member of staff can go to accommodation areas of the opposite
              sex after timetabled bedtime, without being accompanied by a same
              sex staff member{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              No member of staff may enter a student’s bedroom unless the door
              is kept wide open or unless accompanied by another member of staff{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              A member of staff must never enter a changing room of the opposite
              sex{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Male/female showers are clearly signposted and must be respected.
              A member of staff should not go into a showering facility of the
              opposite sex.
            </li>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Reporting a Concern</h2>
        <li>
          Students are with CAMSIS Education for usually two weeks. This limits
          time for abuse to occur, to be noticed, or to be expressed. We
          recognise that students who are abused may find it difficult to
          disclose this to Staff who they have only known for a short while.
          Therefore, we will do all we can to foster a culture of openness and
          trust, as well as equipping Staff with the knowledge needed to
          recognise abuse should it occur.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is also possible that students, who are almost exclusively from
          abroad, may feel that their time away from home is their opportunity
          to disclose abuse in their lives. In both instances a concern for the
          student may arise and it is the responsibility of any staff member
          concerned about a student to voice their concern.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          It is a requirement of the Children Act (1989) and the National
          Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools that adults looking after
          children (those under the age of 18) in CAMSIS Education should be
          aware of the risks of abuse (by adults or other young people), and
          take steps to reduce those risks. They should know what to do if they
          suspect that someone is being physically, sexually, emotionally abused
          or neglected, or if someone tells them that this is happening. This
          includes physical and sexual abuse that is occurring on site, or to a
          student of CAMSIS Education at home or offsite.{" "}
        </li>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Whistleblowing</h2>
        <li>
          All Staff should be aware of their duty to raise concerns, where they
          exist, about the attitude or actions of their colleagues. We recognise
          that students cannot be expected to raise concerns in an environment
          where Staff fail to do so.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          It is noted that the provisions of Section 175 of the Education Act,
          place a general duty on colleges to safeguard and promote the welfare
          of children in their care and, as such, Staff will adhere to other
          related College policies, i.e. Behaviour Policy, Anti-bullying Policy,
          Health and Safety etc.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          As part of their induction training all new Members of Staff at CAMSIS
          Education are given an explanation of this policy as part of their
          induction training and the steps that CAMSIS Education will take when
          concerns are raised by a staff member or a student.{" "}

          Equal Opportunities and Safeguarding{" "}
        </h2>
        <li>
          Some students may be vulnerable to an increased risk of abuse. It is
          important to understand that this increase is always due to societal
          attitudes and child protection procedures that fail to acknowledge
          students’ diverse circumstances, rather than the individual student’s
          personality, impairment or circumstances. Many factors can contribute
          to an increase in risk, including prejudice and discrimination,
          isolation, social exclusion, communication issues, learning
          disabilities and reluctance on the part of some adults to accept that
          abuse can occur.
        </li>
        <li>
          To ensure that all of students receive equal protection, we will give
          special consideration to students who are:
          <ul>
            <li>disabled or have special educational needs</li>
            <li>living in a domestic abuse situation</li>
            <li>vulnerable to being bullied, or engaging in bullying</li>
            <li>living in chaotic and unsupportive home situations</li>
            <li>
              vulnerable to discrimination and maltreatment on the grounds of
              race, ethnicity, religion or sexuality{" "}

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Recognising Abuse</h2>
        <li>
          There are four categories of abuse to recognise in safeguarding:
          <ul>
            <li>Physical abuse - any abuse that causes physical harm.</li>
            <li>
              Emotional Abuse - any abuse causing negative effects on emotional
              development.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Sexual Abuse - forcing a child to engage in sexual activities,
              behave in sexually inappropriate ways or by exposing them to
              sexual activities
            </li>
            <li>
              Neglect - persistent failure to meet a child's basic physical
              and/or psychological needs. This failure can then impair their
              development and/or health.{" "}
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We must also be aware that abuse can be both active and passive,
            that is to say someone can actively harm a child or they can fail to
            act to prevent harm to a child.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Other forms of abuse include Female Genital Mutilation, trafficking
          and modern slavery, Child Sexual Exploitation, Drug Exploitation,
          forced marriage, Radicalisation and Extremism, Bullying/
          Cyberbullying, fabricated or induced illness.

          Prevent Policy – Radicalisation and Extremism
        </h2>
        <li>
          CAMSIS Education is by its nature a multicultural environment where
          students have the opportunity to mix with others from different
          countries and cultures. Under the Counter Terrorism & Securities Act
          2015 has a responsibility to have due regard to the need to prevent
          people from being radicalised or drawn into terrorism. This initiative
          is known as PREVENT and it is designed to try and reduce the
          likelihood of people supporting terrorism or becoming terrorists. It
          also aims to reduce the risk of radicalisation happening within
          institutions. ‘Prevent’ refers to all ages, not just students under
          18.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          PREVENT Terminology and Responsibility
          <ul>
            <li>
              Radicalisation: the act or process of making a person more radical
              or favouring of extreme or fundamental changes in political,
              economic or social conditions, institutions or habits of the mind
            </li>
            <li>
              Extremism: holding extreme political or religious views which may
              deny rights to any group or individual. Can be expressed in vocal
              or active opposition to core British values. Extremism can refer
              to a range of views, e.g. racism, homophobia, right-wing ideology,
              any religious extremism.
            </li>
            <li>
              Core British Values:
              <ul>
                <li>Democracy </li>
                <li>The rule of law</li>
                <li>Individual liberty</li>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              CAMSIS Education meets this responsibility by educating staff in
              the terminology and the risks. Guidance on how to deal with issues
              and arising situations is provided in the Preventing Extremism and
              Radicalisation Policy. If any member of staff is concerned that a
              student is showing signs of becoming radicalised and involved in
              an organisation which could ultimately harm the student then this
              needs to be reported at the centre to the Designated Safeguarding
              Lead.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 ">
          Suspecting a student may be at risk of harm
        </h3>
        <li>
          There will be occasions when you suspect that a student may be at
          risk, but you have no quantifiable evidence. In these circumstances,
          you should try to give the student the opportunity to talk or
          communicate in their preferred method. The signs you have noticed may
          be due to a variety of factors, for example, a parent has moved out, a
          pet has died, a grandparent is very ill. It is fine to ask the student
          if they are ‘okay’ or if you can help in any way.{" "}
        </li>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">If a student discloses to you</h3>
        <li>
          If a student communicates to you any risks around their safety or
          wellbeing you must let them know that you must pass the information
          on. The point at which you do this is a matter for professional
          judgement. Never promise confidentiality as we must act with the
          student's best interests in mind. During your conversation:
          <ul>
            <li>Allow them to speak freely</li>
            <li>Remain calm with composed reactions</li>
            <li>Give reassuring nods or words of comfort</li>
            <li>Do not be afraid of silences </li>
            <li>Under no circumstances ask investigative questions</li>
            <li>
              At an appropriate time tell the child/young person that in order
              to help them you must pass the information on{" "}
            </li>
            <li>Do not automatically offer any physical touch as comfort</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If the child is in immediate harm you must notify the Designated
          Safeguarding Lead immediately and failing that contact the local
          authority. Irrespective of immediate harm, always report the
          conversation to the Designated Safeguarding Lead. Write up the
          situation and series of events as soon as possible and seek support if
          you feel distressed.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Supporting staff</h2>
        <li>
          We recognise that Staff who have become involved with a student who
          has suffered, or is suffering, harm, may find the situation stressful
          and upsetting. We will support Staff by providing an opportunity to
          talk through their anxieties with a director, and/or the Designated
          Safeguarding Lead and we will seek further support whenever needed.
